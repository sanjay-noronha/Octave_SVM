# Octave_SVM
Support Vector Machines in Octave

Concepts:
————
— the concept of landmarks - solving a problem where we need new features
- Kernel - similarity function - gaussian kernel
 - the idea of kernels and similarity is used to define more complex non linear functions
- when to use SVM v. Logistic Regression v Neural Networks [ SANJAY TAKE PHOTO FROM DESKTOP

Activity:
—————

-  using SVM to build a spam classifier
- how outliers affect a decision boundary. very simple example of how we can vary C/lambda to affect the decision boundary
- The concept of ‘tolerance value’ - tol is a tolerance value used for determining equality of floating point numbers. 
- plot a decision boundary - linear
- SVM - linear and Gaussian kernels
    - Implement a gaussian kernel
- Email classification
    - A good piece of code i.e. processEmail.m that contains normalization logic for emails
    - STEMMING of words
